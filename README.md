# beduShop
Shop app using Android studio and kotlin

For the correct use of the code I seggest to use AndroidStudio
  https://developer.android.com/studio

The project implements:
  Layouts y ACtivities
  Fragments
  Lists
  RecyclerAdapter
  Navigation
  Menus
  Material Design
  
  The project simulates the register and login of an user, then you can see the products of the shop and interact with the bottons of the menu
  
  The user to pass throught the login is
    User: test@mail.com
    Pass: pass123
